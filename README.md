MOD 3 JAVASCRIPT PROJECT: 

For this project, my app focuses on creating a simple electronics review app. This simple app allows any public users to pick any electronics and commenting on that specific electronic. Once the user picks a specific electronic, it will show the title, image and info about that spacific item.

For my backend(rails API) of this project, I've created 2 diffrent models: Electronics(showing the list of products such as phines, tablets, etc), and Reviews(for commenting a spacific electronic). For these models, Electronics has many Reviews and Reviews belongs to Electronics. 

For my models, I was using mixing two diffrent style of code, for my eletronics, I used objected orented behavior with crud using the read method.

For my frontend(js, html, css) project, what I add some interesting details using CSS code. For this code, I want my buttons to change colors every time I hover my mouse over the button. To make it work, I use '(className:hover)' in css that will allow the mouse to create an effect such as changing color for the electronics and comment buttons. As for JavaScript, I've created "electronics.js" to create a Object Oriented language with a get method. As for the review, I want the users to create, delete, and update a commet to that spacific item using 'POST', 'DELETE', and 'PATCH'.
